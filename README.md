# StatisticalModeling_JurkatCryopreservation

This R code is used to analyzed the post-thaw recoveries of Jurkat cells cryopreserved with combinations of sucrose, glycerol and isleucine in order to qunatify the importance of each component and its interactions. 
Understanding the interactions of components is beneifical to develop other solutions to cryopreserve cells.

The analysis results has been published on

Another work of the analysis of Jurkat cells cryopreserved with other combinations of sugar, sugar alcohols and amino acids has been published on
